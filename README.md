### About:

The server is `express`.

The language is ES6.

The `ws` library is used for websockets

### Starting
There are two ways to start the app:
- using babel. Use the executables in the `scripts/` folder to do this
- using NodeJs. `npm start` accomplishes this

### The scripts in the `scripts/` folder:

- `scipts/console` is a REPL with the app loaded
- `scripts/compile` will run Babel and save output to the `compiled` folder
- `scripts/run_compiled_app`
- `scripts/compile_and_run` just combines the aformentioned two scripts.
