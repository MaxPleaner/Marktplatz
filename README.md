### How to run this

First go to `scripts/env_setup.sh.example` and fill in the required environment variables. Then remove the `.example` from the extension. This file is in `.gitignore`.

There are two ways to start the server:
- using babel. Use `scripts/compile_and_run` to do this.
- using Node (no compilation). `npm start` accomplishes this, or `nodejs main.js`.

The app can be loaded into a REPL using `scripts/console`.
